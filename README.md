# Elixir RPG ECS Experiment

Welcome to the ECS/Engine portion of the code seen in my ElixirConf 2021 Talk "Game Programming Patterns In Elixir?"

This code is very much: hacky, prototype quality, and probably full of bad ideas.

But if it gives you any cool ideas that are useful in your own projects, then I'm glad! :)
